1. With the more neutral words "course", "the", and "teach", I
didn't really see much difference between the genders. However,
the more "loaded" words "unfair", "funny", and "mean" tended
to favor men (higher "funny" occurrence) than women (higher
"unfair" and "mean" occurrences). This definitely illuminates a
clear gender bias within professor reviews.

2. If I could re-design the ratings website, I would address
this problem by including the pronouns of the professors
(from their website) that corresponds with an identity, or
simply add an option for professors to specify their gender
identity on the website.

3. A different problem related to the topic is client reviews
of female vs. male work. The values being tackled in this are
sexism displayed in client reviews, and this problem is being
solved for women who want to work/ creating a more inclusive
society.
